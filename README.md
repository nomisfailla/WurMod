# WurMod
Wurm Unlimited modding API and implementation.

# Working With Patches
For this you will need a Java compiler, [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/), [Procyon v0.5.36](http://www.javadecompilers.com/) and git.
1. Decompile `client.jar` and place the resulting directories into `Patches/client`.
2. Execute `git apply client.patch`. This will generate patched `.java` files in the `client_patched` directory.
3. Make changes to the files, or add your own. Be sure to follow the patch style guide outlined below.
4. Once you are done, you can execute `ant` to build the patched class files into the `out` directory.
5. Execute `make_patch.bat` to update the `client.patch` file, and commit.

If the patch generated by `make_patch.bat` is gigantic, execute `git config --global core.autocrlf false`. You can set this value back to true once you're finished.

### Patch Style Guide
In order to make it clear when looking at the patched code what parts have been updated, all added code should be surrounded by the comment `// WurMod`.
For example;
```java
public void SomeConstructor() {
	// WurMod: Optional description of what we are doing.
	this.field = someValue;
	this.field.call();
	// WurMod
}
```
In cases where edits are made in the middle of an existing line, a single comment should be placed above the line with a description of what was changed.
For example;
```java
this.field = new SomeClass();

// Could become...

// WurMod: Pass the value to the class
this.field = new SomeClass(ourValue);
```
